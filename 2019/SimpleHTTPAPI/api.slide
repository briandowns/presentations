* What is REST?

- REST stands for "Representational State Transfer"
- Architectual style for building web services

* Why REST?

- Binds existing standards and technologies together like the methods in RFC 2616.
 - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

* Why JSON?

- Ubiquitous in frontend environments
- Simple for people and machines

* What do we want to build?

* Access Patterns

- How do we want to access our data? 
- What do we need to do with this data?

* Building Routes

The API routes should be obvious if possible.

* Data Modeling

* Requests and Responses

Having a specific contracts between the API and the consumer is a critical component to REST API's. These contracts should be rock solid and never leave room for ambiguity.

* Error Handling

* Conclusion

REST is a style of building web services that takes advantage of existing standards and technologies to allow for building simple, reliable, and performant systems.
